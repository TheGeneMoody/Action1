Instructions:

If you would like to modify anything, colors, timeout, etc... 
Modify the appropriate c# and run the compile script.
Script accepts path and filename to source file as first argument.
Path and filename to output file as second argument, appends '.exe' automatically.

Example: 

make <patch to code file> <path and name of output file>

make "c:\...\source.cs" "c:\...\path\Action1_Remote_Indicator"
